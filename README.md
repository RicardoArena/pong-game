# Pong Game

The pong game was chosen by me as the theme of my first solo project at Ironhack's bootcamp, which basically consisted of creating a game using Vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
The game does not yet have all the mechanics and features of the classic game, which is just an attempt to reproduce the original content.

The game can be tested [here](https://ricardoarena.github.io/pong-game/)
